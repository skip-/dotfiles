#
# this is off by default because it's dangerous; use Window_Ops -> Close instead
#Mouse 0 7 A Delete


# MouseFocus is the default if none is
# specified; focus changes as mouse enters
# or leaves a window
#Style "*"	MouseFocus

# SloppyFocus leaves focus in the last window
# active after mouse leaves, switches when
# when mouse enters a new window
#Style "*"	SloppyFocus

# ClickToFocus leaves focus in the last window
# active after mouse leaves, switches only

# Mouse scrolling of the viewer window across the virtual workspace:
# default 0 0 disables this feature, most people do not want it.
EdgeScroll	0 0
#
# Other examples: permit edge scrolling 25% both directions.
#EdgeScroll	25 25
#
# Permit horizontal scrolling only by 1 full pane (0 100 for vertical).
#EdgeScroll 100 0

# default bindings have been set for Scroll:
# alt+arrow     10%
# control+arrow 100%

# uncomment if you prefer Ctrl-Arrow keyboard scrolling to wrap around
#Key Left	A	C	Scroll	-100000	+0
#Key Right	A	C	Scroll	+100000	+0
#Key Up		A	C	Scroll	+0	-100000

# system defaults apply functions to these keys which may disable features
# of some applications (e.g. mozilla alt-left/alt-right for history back/fwd)
#
# uncomment if you prefer to disable the default alt/arrow and/or
# ctrl/arrow scrolling of the virtual workspace

# Prior to March 2006 this feature was opt-out.
# A few customers asked for it to be opt-in.

# If you do not need function keys passed to other
# applications (CAD tools), you can make these
# bindings work without the shift key.  Defaults
# use this:  Key F#   A   S  GotoPage # #
#
# Changing S to N enables the function with no modifiers.
#
# Map Function keys to 4 pages, Control Function keys to 4 desks

#       |  F9   |  F10  |
#       +-------+-------+
#       |  F11  |  F12  |
#       +-------+-------+

# These functions require shift key to activate so
# we do not disable F-keys in other applications; some
# cad tools have frequently used functions bound to
# them.

#Key F9          A       N       GotoPage 0 0
#Key F10         A       N       GotoPage 1 0
#Key F11         A       N       GotoPage 0 1
#Key F12         A       N       GotoPage 1 1

# If you want to remove bindings completely,
# use the null "-" action as follows:
#
# Key F9		A	S	-
# Key F10		A	S	-
# Key F11		A	S	-
# Key F12		A	S	-
# Key F9		R	N	-
# Key F10		R	N	-
# Key F11		R	N	-
# Key F12		R	N	-


# Similar defaults are set for <ctrl>+F9-F12
# in the fvwm2rc-hbuttonbar and -vbuttonbar.
# If your application uses control-F9 etc.,
# you may want to unbind them as follows:
#
#Key F9                A       C       -
#Key F10               A       C       -
#Key F11               A       C       -
#Key F12               A       C       -


#If you prefer Icons not to stick across Pages
#Style "*" SlipperyIcon

#If you prefer smaller xterm icons
#Style "xterm*"     BorderWidth 5, HandleWidth 5, Icon IconNotThere.xpm, Title

#If you prefer to double click on icons to de-iconify instead of single click
#DestroyFunc "Move-or-Iconify"
#AddToFunc "Move-or-Iconify" "M" Move
#+                           "D" Iconify
